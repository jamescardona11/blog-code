- Better comments

  This extension allows you to write comments by annotating with an alert, query, informational, TODOs, etc. This is very helpful while working in a team, which is in the majority of cases. Though I genuinely want every IDE to come inbuilt with this feature, till then we have to stick to such awesome extensions!
  
  
  
  This is another popular extension used by VS code developers. It helps in creating colorful comments which actually makes comments more readable. This helps in maintaining the code comments in a better way. Comments helps other developers in the team or our future self. You can write TODOs in the comments which helps in future to not miss any important works. In the comments you just have to start with * or ! or ? or TODO and automatically it will have a particular color.

- Bracket pair colorizer

 This extension as the name suggests colors the pair of brackets of a method, widget, constructor! In Flutter where we have to deal with deeply nested widget trees, this seems to be a lifesaver for finding common bracket misplacing. The user is independent to define which tokens to match, and which colors to use.
 
 
 Often we get lost in the maze of nested widget trees and nested classes, spending a lot of time to find the bracket pair. This extension makes it easier to find the bracket pair by color coding it. You can customize the colors and a lot of other features related to brackets and display of active scope. It also provides keyboard shortcuts for expanding (shift+alt+right) and undo (shift+alt+left) of bracket selection

- Error lens

 This is probably the most underrated one. It highlights the line where the compiler error occurs and print the language-specific message inline. Here is the best part, this extension is not only limited to Flutter.
For funky devs; The color to be shown can be customized in settings.json file. This will give a more appealing look to your errors!


- Flutter color

 Many times we work with different colors and this extension comes in handy to see the color which is given by styling the color in our code itself.

- Git graph
- Git lens

    It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.



- Image preview

  I love this extension!
While working with Flutter it is a quite difficult task for me to immediately insert the name of an image file in my code. I am fond of using long names for my image. This extension came to my rescue when I started working with Flutter. This extension simply shows image preview in the editor’s gutter and on hover. Extremely useful to check if we haven’t made any typo in the image’s path. This is a preview from the marketplace:


- Material icon theme

 Material Theme Icons is use to show attractive icon theme to the folder which look attractive. It also makes it easier to identify the files and folders.
How to use it?
Launch command palette (by default, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, ⌘+Shift+P on Mac) and type Material Icons, choose Activate Icon Theme. After activation, the icons will appear in your explorer sidebar. It has lots of customizations such as you can change the color, etc.

- One dark pro
- Path autocomplete

  This is very useful extension where it will give you path completions for your files or folders. This makes it easier to add images or any resources to our files.



- Pubspec assist
  
  Bored with visiting pub.dev to add dependencies in your project!
This extension directly searches the dependencies from the VS Code itself and adds them to pubspec.yaml file.
However, there is a catch! Pubspec assist get you the latest version of whatever package you are looking for. In my case, I usually prefer looking at some recently launched versions while adding new dependencies. But this is my personal catch and most of you won’t be affected by this feature.


  This is the one of the most famous and used extension created by Jeroen Meijer which is suggested by a lot of top flutter developers. This make it easier to add pubs to pubspec.yaml, all without leaving your editor. This only adds the latest version, hence it can also be used for updating existing pubs.
How to use it?
Simply open the Command Palette (by default, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, ⌘+Shift+P on Mac) and search for "Pubspec Assist", type the package name and press return; it will take some time to search and provide the results.
Then, choose any of the available options .


- Svg previewer
- Todo tree


  Todo Tree by Gruntfuggly comes very handy, not only in flutter, but in VS Code in general. It shows all the TODO and FIXME tags in your code in a Treeview in the explorer, thus helping us directly address them without searching for them manually in the code, saving a lot of time.


- Version lens
- Dart barrel file generator
